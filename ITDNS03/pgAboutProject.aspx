            Now a day the usage of credit cards has dramatically increased. As credit
            card becomes the most popular mode of payment for both online as well as regular
            purchase, cases of fraud associated with it are also rising. In this paper, we model
            the sequence of operations in credit card transaction processing using a Hidden
            Markov Model (HMM) and show how it can be used for the detection of frauds. An HMM
            is initially trained with the normal behavior of a cardholder. If an incoming credit
            card transaction is not accepted by the trained HMM with sufficiently high probability,
            it is considered to be fraudulent. At the same time, we try to ensure that genuine
            transactions are not rejected. We present detailed experimental results to show
            the effectiveness of our approach and compare it with other techniques available
            in the literature.</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
